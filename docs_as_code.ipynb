For more information on security, go to the [Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html).  \n\nWhile Jupyter notebooks primarily use Python, they can also support R, Julia, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, and Haskell. You can also display Jupyter notebooks on [Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214144/jupyter-viewer-for-confluence?hosting=server&tab=overview) using a third-party macro. Go to the [macro documentation](https://mibexsoftware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IPYTHON4CC/pages/2642804737/Notebook+examples) for an example.\n\n## Live Code\nUsers can try out code samples within the document itself. In a live Jupyter notebook, users can click **Run** in the upper navigation bar to try out code in real time. \n\n### Sample Function Code"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def print_two(*args):\n    arg1, arg2 = args\n    print(f\"Crunchyroll\\'s mascots are {arg1} and {arg2}.\")\n    \ndef print_one(arg1):\n    print(f\"We're working at {arg1}.\")\n\nprint_one(\"Crunchyroll\")\nprint_two(\"Hime\",\"Yuzu\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Sample Input Code"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"name = input(\"What's your name? \")\nanime = input(\"What's your favorite anime? \")\ncharacter = input(\"Who's your favorite anime character? \")\n\nprint(f\"Hi {name}!

Google hosts all of TensorFlow's tutorials on Google Colab. Google Colab is Google Research's hosted Jupyter notebook service. Essentially, it allows users to host and run python notebooks through Google Cloud instead of running in the user's local machine with their system's ram storage.\n\nFor an example tutorial, go to the [TensorFlow 2 quickstart guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb#scrollTo=7FP5258xjs-v)."},{"metadata":{},"id":"generic-motel","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# More Information"},{"metadata":{},"id":"above-wisconsin","cell_type":"markdown","source":"* [File for this notebook](https://github.com/crledlie/test/blob/main/docs_as_code.ipynb)\n* [Jupyter Installation Instructions](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#install)\n* [Jupyter Qt Console](https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n* [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer)\n* [Netflix Article](https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233) \n* [Scheduled Notebooks](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/68348)\n* [Titus](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/titus-the-netflix-container-management-platform-is-now-open-source-f868c9fb5436)\n* [Google Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/best-practices-that-can-improve-the-life-of-any-developer-using-jupyter-notebooks)\n* [Tensor Flow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization.ipynb)\n* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)\n* [nteract](https://blog.nteract.io/designing-the-nteract-data-explorer-f4476d53f897) \n* [Sample nteract page](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/nteract-examples-f8shraxi/nteract/edit/python/happiness.ipynb)\n* [Sample data page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/fonnesbeck/2352771)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.13","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
